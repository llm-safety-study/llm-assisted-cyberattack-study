# Prompt Strategy Categories

This study treats prompt strategy as an experimental variable rather than incidental input.

## Strategy Classes

- Character play
- Re-contextualization
- Iterative refinement

These categories are described at a conceptual level only. Exact prompt text is intentionally omitted to prevent misuse.

## Rationale

The objective is to analyze *model behavior patterns*, not to provide reusable adversarial prompts. Observed behaviors were consistent across multiple variants within each category.
