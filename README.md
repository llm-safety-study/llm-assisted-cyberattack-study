# Reproducibility Artifacts: Capability Boundaries of LLM-Assisted Cyberattacks

This repository provides anonymized, non-operational artifacts supporting the paper:

**“Capability Boundaries of LLM-Assisted Cyberattacks: An Empirical Evaluation”**

The purpose of this repository is to enable *methodological reproducibility* and *experimental transparency* while preventing misuse of offensive techniques.

## Scope

This repository mirrors the structure and assumptions of the paper. It documents:
- Threat model assumptions
- Experimental environment configuration
- Prompt strategy categories (at a high level)
- Case-study methodology
- Observed outcomes and failure modes

It does **not** contain:
- Exploit payloads
- Operational malware code
- Exact prompts
- Step-by-step attack instructions

## Ethical Framing

All experiments were conducted in sandboxed virtual environments using intentionally vulnerable systems for research purposes only. Certain materials are intentionally withheld to prevent direct replication of harmful activity. This follows responsible disclosure practices in security research.

See `/ethics` for details.
